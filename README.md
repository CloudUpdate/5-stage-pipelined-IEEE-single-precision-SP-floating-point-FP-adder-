# 5-stage-pipelined-IEEE-single-precision-SP-floating-point-FP-adder-
The design has two parts:
Part A 
Designed an un-pipelined SP FP adder, with results in the form of value and waveforms for certain test cases. 
Part B 
Modified the design to the 5-stage pipelined FP adder. This design takes 12 cycles to output all 8 cases. Stage 1: Compares the exponents and determine the amount of shifts required to align the mantissa to make the exponents equal (alignment-1). Stage 2: Right-shift the mantissa of the smaller exponent by the required amount (alignment-2). Stage 3: Compares the two aligned mantissas and determine which is the smaller of the two. This is followed by takeing 2â€™s complement of the smaller mantissa if the signs of the two numbers are different (addition). Stage 4: Add the two mantissas. Then, determine the amount of shifts required and the corresponding direction to normalize the result (normalization-1). Stage 5: Shift the mantissa to the required direction by the required amount. Adjust the exponent accordingly and check for any exceptional condition (normalization-2).
